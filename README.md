# Enhancing_Image_Classification_in_Low-Light_Conditions_Using_Modified_CNN_Algorithms
The modifications to CNN architectures and specialized preprocessing techniques to enhance their performance in such conditions. Using the ”Exclusively Dark” image dataset (as in ”See Loh &amp; Chan (2019) for more information.”), we aim to validate and showcase the advantages of our approach.
